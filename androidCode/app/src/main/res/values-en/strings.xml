    <string name="verhaal_de_verloren_sleutel">Mia lived in a quiet village, surrounded by lush forests. One sunny morning she discovered that her old, trusty set of keys was missing. Panic flooded her as these keys opened the doors to her fondest memories. She searched every corner of her house, but in vain.  With a frustrated sigh, Mia decided to head into the village, hoping that the keys had fallen somewhere in the lush greenery. She searched for hours, until the sun began to set. Just as she was about to give up hope, something sparkled among the bushes.  There lay her set of keys, glistening in the last light of the day. She picked up the keys with a feeling of relief and joy. As she walked back home, Mia realized that sometimes to find what we\'re looking for, we must first be lost.</string>

    <string name="verhaal_het_geheim_van_de_verzonken_schat">Deep beneath the ocean\'s surface, hidden from prying eyes, lay a sunken city, shrouded in mystery and legend. Its glittering towers and ancient ruins had once been home to a thriving civilization, but now it rested at the bottom of the sea, forgotten by the world above.  One stormy night, when the waves were splashing high and thunder was rolling over the sea, a brave explorer named Alex set out to unravel the secret of the sunken city. With an ancient map in his hand and a fire in his heart, he navigated the tumultuous waters in search of the legendary underwater kingdom.  When he finally reached the sunken city, Alex was overwhelmed by its beauty and mystery. He dived deep beneath the waves, his breath mingling with the song of the sea, and entered the ancient streets of the city.  As he walked the deserted hallways, Alex discovered clues and artifacts that told him about the glory and fall of the ancient civilization. He felt the echoes of their stories resonating through the ruins, like whispers from times long past.  Finally, in the heart of the sunken city, Alex found the secret he was looking for: an ancient temple dedicated to the protection of the city and its inhabitants. There, in the sanctuary of the temple, he discovered an artifact that was the key to unraveling the mystery of the sunken city.  With the artifact in his hand and the knowledge in his heart, Alex returned to the surface, his mission accomplished but his adventure not yet over. As he braved the waves and sailed home, he knew that the memory of the sunken city would remain in his mind forever, as an eternal symbol of discovery and adventure.</string>
